=Q & A=
----

==Why screenshots and manpages are not exactly the same as what I see in the program?==
Yeah, some are based on older versions, but not a big deal.

Also note that the command list in the manpage is only a subset.


==So where is the full command list?==

In scanmem see `help`, and you may also want to try `help option`. Don't worry, the nice pager 'more' is embedded.

In GameConqueror, just see the tooltip of the label "Value:" -- yeah, that's basically the same of what you see in scanmem. Also don't forget to check the tooltips of other controls. 


==Why run as root?==

Ptrace is recently being protected in some OSes.

For example, Ubuntu 10.10, see:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace%20Protection

Normal user may no longer be able to attach other non-child processes.
