Scanmem
============

scanmem is a debugging utility designed to isolate the address of an arbitrary
variable in an executing process. scanmem simply needs to be told the pid of
the process, and the value of the variable at several different times.

After several scans of the process, scanmem isolates the position of the
variable and allows you to modify it's value.

Requirements
============

scanmem requires libreadline to read commands interactively, and /proc must be
mounted.


Install
=======
If you obtained the source from the source repository (instead of a archive), run:
  ./autogen.sh

To build with gui:

  ./configure --enable-gui && make    
  sudo make install

To build without gui:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install


GUI
===

Now scanmem has a GUI front-end called GameConqueror, to use it, add --enable-gui when configure
See gui/README for more detail.


Known Issues
============

* some hardened systems have unusable maps files, where all entries are zeroed.
* the snapshot command uses too much memory on large processes.
* performance is currently very poor.
