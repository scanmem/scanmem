Next Version
============
* error code in show_messages
* use /proc/pid/mem if possible; use PT_IO on freebsd, instead of PT_READ/WRITE_D
* optimize `if (xxx == 1)`
* optional float rounding method, eg floor(), ceil(), round(), rint(), etc?
* performance
* speedhack
* bytearray flag check (truncval_to_flags, checkmatches, update command for bytearray&string)

Future
======
* in target_memory_info_array.c, need check return value of allocate_enough_to_reach everywhere
* save state to a file, so you can apply it to a different pid.
* search for values in files? (eg saved state)
* macro support
* read symbol table, and print its name if we have a match.
* support more esoteric number formats, such as bcd, ascii, etc.
* pagination
* some sort of regression testing, probably using dejagnu.
    - test target that mmaps testfile, then dregions the rest using dejagnu
    - then can test searching using tests.
* automatically support zero and one based values.
* show log
    -> ring buffer of 512 debug messages, that may help on debug
    -> eg push("a region was removed as it appears to have been umapped");
    -> show log
        - [xx:yy] a region.."
* dont read the whole region at a time, read max 8M or something.
