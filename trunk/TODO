Next Version
============
* some sort of regression testing, probably using dejagnu.
    - test target that mmaps testfile, then dregions the rest using dejagnu
    - then can test searching using tests.
* automatically support zero and one based values.
* add inverted matches for set and delete, eg
    - delete !13  - delete all matches except 13
    - set !13,12,10=3 - set all matches except 13,12 and 10 to 3.
* prompt on strange operations (eg, listing 10 million matches)
    - add options command to disable prompts.
* optional float rounding techniques, eg floor(), ceil(), round(), rint(), etc?
* add similar syntax as set to dregion, delete and watch.
    - watch 12,23,5 - watch these three matches
* improve show command.
* known type: 0x324/I <- ints with value 0x324
* > 4 ; value is now greater than 4
* show log
    -> ring buffer of 512 debug messages, that may help on debug
    -> eg push("a region was removed as it appears to have been umapped");
    -> show log
        - [xx:yy] a region.."
* dont read the whole region at a time, read max 8M or something.
* search for values in files? (eg saved state)

Future
======
* macro support
* read symbol table, and print its name if we have a match.
* support more esoteric number formats, such as bcd, ascii, etc.
* pagination
* save state to a file, so you can apply it to a different pid.
* find strings, or pointers to strings as well?
