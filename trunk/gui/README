==============
Game Conqueror is a graphical game cheating tool under Linux, as a frontend of scanmem.


Requirements
===========
scanmem (latest version)
Python (2.x)
PyGObject
GTK+ 3


Usage
=====
You are supposed to be familiar with cheating tools like CheatEngine

- Search for a value in the Value entry, then press Enter or the scan buttons
  * Check supported syntax via the '?' mark 
  * You scan enable/disable searching for integer/float using the checkboxes.
  * Pay attention to 'Found: XX' at topleft 
  * Results will be displayed in the left list if there are not too many 
- Add a candidate address to the list below by double-click on it or use the context-menu
- There you can edit description, value, and lock it.

!! Currently only '=' locking is supported, which means the '>' and '<' flags are useless
!! Pay attention to the output of GameConqueror, you'll see error messages from scanmem -- so GameConqueror is recommended to be executed in a shell
