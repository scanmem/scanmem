Game Conqueror
==============
Game Conqueror is a graphical game cheating tool under Linux, as a frontend of scanmem.

Interface and user-feeling are expected to be similar and hopefully better than CheatEngine (a powerful cheating tool under Windows).



Requirement
===========
scanmem (latest version)
Python
PyGTK



Usage
=====
You are supposed to be able to use cheating tools like CheatEngine

- Search for a value in the Value entry, then press Enter or the scan buttons
  * Use syntax supported by scanmem
  * Pay attention to 'Found: XX' at topleft 
  * Results will be displayed in the left list if there are not too many 
- Add a candidate address to the list below by double-click on it or use the context-menu
- There you can edit description, value, and lock it.

!! Currently only integer scanning are supported, the width is auto-detected (and can only be auto-detected)
!! Currently only '=' locking is supported, which means the '>' and '<' flags are useless
!! Pay attention to the output of GameConqueror, you'll see error messages from scanmem -- so GameConqueror is recommended to be executed in a shell


Comparing with CheatEngine
==========================
You may have a feeling of deja vu, because the UI is almost a clone of CheatEngine, yep, that's right
And here's the differences:

Adv. of GameConqueror
---------------------
* flexible syntax & command line -- powered by scanmem
  - you can type the commands supported by scanmem directly in the Value entry (Note: this might not be true in the future releases)

Disadv.of GameConqueror
-----------------------
* Lots of things not implemented -- still under working
* memory editing might be supported, but not ASM things
