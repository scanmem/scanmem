Game Conqueror
==============
Game Conqueror is a graphical game cheating tool under Linux, as a frontend of scanmem.

Interface and user-feeling are expected to be similar and hopefully better than CheatEngine (a powerful cheating tool under Windows).



Requirement
===========
scanmem (latest version)
Python
PyGTK



Usage
=====
You are supposed to be able to use cheating tools like CheatEngine

- Search for a value in the Value entry, then press Enter or the scan buttons
  * Use syntax supported by scanmem
    1. <an integer>: search for the number -- so far you should provide an integer even when search for a float number, 
                    and rounding will be used
    2. <, =, >: search for values that decreased, not changed, and increased, respectively
  * You scan enable/disable searching for integer/float using the checkboxes.
  * Pay attention to 'Found: XX' at topleft 
  * Results will be displayed in the left list if there are not too many 
- Add a candidate address to the list below by double-click on it or use the context-menu
- There you can edit description, value, and lock it.

!! Currently only '=' locking is supported, which means the '>' and '<' flags are useless
!! Pay attention to the output of GameConqueror, you'll see error messages from scanmem -- so GameConqueror is recommended to be executed in a shell


Comparing with CheatEngine
==========================
You may have a feeling of deja vu, because the UI is almost a clone of CheatEngine, yep, that's right
And here's the differences:

Adv. of GameConqueror/scanmem
---------------------
* data type/width auto detected -- you won't need to struggle among them anymore!
* flexible syntax -- to be implemented


Disadv.of GameConqueror/scanmem
-----------------------
* memory editing might be supported
* currently, assemble/disassemble/pointers are not taken into consideration
