xxxx-xx-xx Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * fixed infinite loop if a command was just leading whitespace.
    * add message to configure script about `libreadline-dev` package.
    * correct some typos reported by debian.

2007-06-07 Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * make license clearer, added gpl notice to all source files, and added a show command.
        - eg, show copying, show warranty, etc.
    * handle unspecified value in set properly, eg set /4
    * autotooled the build process.
    * fixed bug where unaligned variables might be missed at end of region.
    * begin testsuite using dejagnu, to help prevent any regressions in future.
    * use /proc/pid/mem if available.

2007-04-08 Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * corrected lots of lint errors.
    * include copy of GPL in COPYING file.
    * use more EXPECT().
    * fixed two memory leaks (very small).
    * much more scalable commandline parsing, simple switch/case was getting too unwieldy.
    * deprecated cont command, and re-wrote set to make it much more powerful.
        - use set x/y instead of cont, cont will print a warning if you try to use it.
    * preliminary support for float type (WARNING: experimental)
    * implemented simple custom completer for readline, so tab completion now works for commands.
        - arguments will work with completion in next version.
    * massive improvements to online help, each command can register its own documentation.
        - example : `help set` will now print detailed usage information.
    * added quick shell escape support (shell command).
    * added interrupt support to commands that continue until stopped.
    * changed the format of list output, which now has a set of flags that represent
      the possible formats that this variable could be, eg 'CSi' means could be a char
       or a short, but cant be an int.
    * new command `watch` that monitors how a variable changes.
    * updated manual
    
2007-03-04 Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * buffered overlapping peeks to improve scan performance.
    * automatically support chars, shorts and ints.
        - removed width command
    * pid command can change target.
    * = command, to accompany < and > to indicate variable has not changed.
    * snapshot command to enhance <, > and =. WARNING: experimental, very inefficient.
        - snapshot will use a more efficient format next version, right now it
          should not be used on large programs, or will eat all your free memory.

2007-01-11 Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * cleaned up some lintian errors
    * used __builtin_expect() to try to improve performance in some areas
    * minor UI tweaks, give region counts during scan.
    * start using readline(), should implement completion at some point.
    * fixed memory leak.

2006-11-16 Tavis Ormandy <taviso@sdf.lonestar.org>
    * Made buffer management more intelligent.
    * Add commands to list and delete regions (lregions, dregion).
    * Add commands to indicate variable has increased or decreased (<, >).
    * Improved usability of set, cont, list, etc.
    * Add progress meter, large programs can take a long time for initial scan.
    * Testing support for variable width targets, signedness not currenlty handled.
    * delete command to eliminate matches.
    * list command now shows where a variable is located.
    * General code cleanup.
    * Eliminate useless command line options, use interactive versions instead.
    * Improved documentation.
