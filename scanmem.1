.TH scanmem 1 "2016-12-17" "scanmem-0.16.2"
.SH NAME
scanmem - locate and modify a variable in an executing process.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scanmem
.RB [options]
.IR [target-program-pid]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scanmem
is an interactive debugging utility that can be used to isolate the address of a variable
in an executing process by successively scanning the process' address space looking for
matching values. By informing
.B scanmem
how the value of the variable changes over time, it can determine the actual location (or
locations) of the variable by successively eliminating non-matches.
.B scanmem
determines where to look by searching for mappings with
.I read
/
.I write
permission, these are referred to as regions. Users can eliminate regions they believe are
likely unrelated to the target variable (for example, located in a shared library unrelated to
the variable in question), this will improve the speed of the scan, which can initially be quite
slow in large programs.

Once a variable has been found,
.B scanmem
can monitor the variable, or change it to a user specified value, either once, or continually
over a period of time.

.B scanmem
.RI "works similarly to the \(dq" pokefinders "\(dq once commonly used to cheat at video games,"
this function is a good demonstration of how to use
.BR scanmem ", and is used in the documentation."

.SH USAGE
.B scanmem
should be invoked with the process id of the program you wish to debug as an argument. Once
started,
.B scanmem
accepts interactive commands. These are described below, however entering
.IR help
at the
.B >
prompt will allow you to access
.BR scanmem "'s"
online documentation.

The
.IR target-program-pid
can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal using the standard C language notation
(leading 0x for hexadecimal, leading 0 for octal, anything else is assumed to be decimal).

.BI "\-p, \-\-pid=" pid

Set the
.IR "target-program-pid".

.B "\-v, \-\-version"

Print version and exit.

.B "\-h, \-\-help"

Print a short description of command line options then exit.

.B "\-d, \-\-debug"

Run in debug mode, more information will be outputted.

.SH COMMANDS

While in interactive mode,
.BR scanmem " prints a decimal number followed by " > ", the number is the current number of"
possible candidates for the target variable that are known. 0 indicates that no possible variables
have been eliminated yet.
The default scan data type is "int".
.RB "It can be changed with the " option " command."

.B n

Where
.B n
represents any number in decimal, octal or hexadecimal, this command tells
.B scanmem
that the current value of the target variable is exactly
.BR n "."
.B scanmem
will begin a search of the entire address space, or the existing known matches (if any),
eliminating any variable that does not have this value.

.B n..m

This is like the
.B n
command but
.B scanmem
searches for a range of numbers between
.B n
and
.B m
inclusive instead.

.BR ">", " <", " =", " !=" ", ..."

The following commands are extremely useful for locating a variable where we cannot see its
exact value but we can see for example how it changes over time like with a health bar. These
commands usually cannot be used for the first scan but there are some exceptions:
.BR "> " n, " < " n, " = " "n and" " != " n.

.BI "> " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that are greater than " n "."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have increased."

.BI "< " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that are less than " n "."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have decreased."

.BI "+ " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that have been increased by " n "."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have increased (same as " > ")."

.BI "- " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that have been decreased by " n "."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have decreased (same as " < ")."

.BI "= " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that are equal to " n " (same as " n ")."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have not changed."

.BI "!= " [n]

.RI "If " n " is given, match values that are different from " n "."
.RB "Otherwise match all values that have changed."

.B snapshot

Match any value. This is useful when an initial value or range is not known for
subsequent scans with
.BR > ", " < ", " + ", " - ", " = ", and " != "."

.BI "\(dq " text

Search for the provided
.I text
in memory if the scan data type is set to "string".

.B update

Scans the current process, getting the current values of all matches. These values can be viewed with
.BR list ", and are also the old values that " scanmem " compares to when using"
.BR > ", " < ", or " = "."
This command is equivalent to a search command that all current results match.

.B list

List all the possible candidates currently known, including their address, region id, match offset,
region type, last known value and possible value types.
The value in the first column is the match id, and can be used in conjunction with the
.B delete
command to eliminate matches.

For experts: The match offset is determined by subtracting the load address of the associated
ELF file or region from the address. It can be used to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR).

.B delete
.I match-id

Delete match
.IR match-id ", which can be found from the output of the"
.B list
command. To delete all matches, see the
.B reset
command, or to delete all matches associated with a particular library, see the
.B dregion
command, which also removes any associated matches. Please note that match-ids may be
recalculated after matches are removed or added.

.B watch
.I match-id

Monitor the value of
.IR match-id ", and print its value as it changes. Every change is printed along with a timestamp,"
you can interrupt this command with ^C to stop monitoring.

.B set
.I [match-id][,match-id,...]=]value[/delay] [...]

Set the value
.IR value " into the match numbers " match-id ", or if just "
.IR value " is specified, all known matches."
.I value
can be specified in standard C language notation. All known matches, along with their
match-id's can be displayed using the
.B list
command. Multiple
.IR match-id's " can be specified, separated with commas and terminated with an "
.IR = " sign. To set a value continually, suffix the command with " /
followed by the number of seconds to wait between sets. You can interrupt the set command
with ^C to return to the
.B scanmem
prompt. This can be used to sustain the value of a variable which decreases overtime, for
example a timer that is decremented every second can be set to 100 every 10 seconds to
prevent some property from ever changing.

This command is used to change the value of the variable(s) once found by elimination.
Please note, some applications will store values in multiple locations.

.B write
.I value_type address value

Manually set the value of the variable at the specified address.

Names of
.I value_type
are subject to change in different versions of
.BR scanmem ","
see more info using the `help write` command.

.B dump
.I address length [filename]

Dump the memory region starting from
.I address
of length
.I length
in a human-readable format.

If
.I filename
is given, data will be saved into the file, otherwise data will be displayed on stdout.

.B pid
.I [new-pid]

Print out the process id of the current target program, or change the target to
.IR new-pid ", which will reset existing regions and matches."

.B reset

Forget all known regions and matches and start again.

.B lregions

List all the known regions, this can be used in combination with the
.B dregion
command to eliminate regions that the user believes are not related to the variable in question,
thus reducing the address space required to search in. The value in the first column is the
.I region-id
which must be passed to the
.B dregion
command. Besides the start address, the size and path (if applicable) are also printed. This can be
used to eliminate regions located in shared libraries that are unlikely to be relevant to the
variable required.

For experts: Also the region type and the load address are displayed. The types are "exe" (executable)
"code" (library), "heap", "stack" or "misc" (everything else). The load address is the memory location
where an ELF file (exe/lib) has been loaded to. This helps to convert between the addresses in memory
and in the associated ELF file. If the region does not belong to an ELF file, then it is the same as
the start address.

.B dregion
.I [!]region-id[,region-id][,...]

Delete the region
.IR region-id ", along with any matches from the match list. The"
.I region-id
can be found in the output of the
.B lregions
command. A leading
.I !
indicates the list should be inverted.

.B option
.I name value

Change options at runtime. E.g. the scan data type can be changed.
See `help option` for all possible names/values.

.B shell
.I shell-command

Execute
.I shell-command
using /bin/sh, then return.

.B show
.I info

Display information relating to
.I info
- see `help show` for details.

.B version

Print the version of
.B scanmem
in use.

.B help

Print a short summary of available commands.

.BR exit

Detach from the target program and exit immediately.

.SH EXAMPLES
Cheat at nethack, on systems where nethack is not installed sgid.

.B ATTENTION: scanmem
usually requires root privileges. See
.B BUGS
for details.

16 potential matches were found, many of them are quite unrelated, as they are part of
the stack, belong to libraries or miscellaneous memory-mapped files. Even the heap is
unlikely for a very old command line game. We could make
.B scanmem
eliminate these manually using the
.B delete
command, however just waiting until the amount of gold changes and telling
.B scanmem
the new value should be enough. I find some more gold, and tell
.B scanmem
the new value, 83.

Only one of the 16 original candidates now has the value 83, so this must be where the
amount of gold is stored. I'll try setting it to 10,000 pieces.

The resulting nethack status:

.fi

Conclusion: We've found and modified the gold value as I32 in static memory of the executable
at virtual memory address 0x7b09e0. This address belongs to the region with id 1.

Now it is important to know if this is a position-independent executable (PIE). We list the
regions for this and check the load address of the executable.

.fi

We are on x86_64 and 0x400000 is the static load address for executables there. This means
that this is not a PIE and the gold is always stored at 0x7b09e0. This makes it easy to
use a game trainer like GameConqueror which refills the gold value periodically.

With a PIE we have to use the match offset (0x3b09e0 here) instead and an advanced game trainer
with PIE support has to determine and add the current load address to it to get the current
memory address of the gold value of the current game run.

.SH NOTES

.B scanmem
has been tested on multiple large programs, including the 3d shoot-em-up quake3 linux.
.B scanmem
is also tested on ARM platforms and comes with Android support since version 0.16.

Obviously,
.B scanmem
can crash your program if used incorrectly.

Some programs store values in multiple locations, this is why
.B set
will change all known matches.

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) together with position-independent executables
(PIE), position-independent code (PIC) or dynamic memory on the heap causes variables to
be loaded to different memory addresses at every game start. Advanced game trainers like
ugtrain are required to periodically refill variables is such memory regions.

.SH BUGS

.B scanmem
usually requires root privileges for
.BR ptrace (2)
because security modules control ptrace() capabilities. On x86 and x86_64 there is usually
the
.B Yama
security module providing the file
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope "."
It is available since Linux 3.4. If this file contains "1", then only parents may ptrace()
their children without root privileges. This means that
.B scanmem
would have to run the game. This is not possible as this would require major design
changes. So we run
.B scanmem
as root.

The first scan can be very slow on large programs, this is not a problem for subsequent 
scans as huge portions of the address space are usually eliminated. This could be improved
in future, perhaps by assuming all integers are aligned by default. Suggestions welcome.

The
.B snapshot
command uses memory inefficiently, and should probably not be used on large programs.
In future this will use a more intelligent format.
